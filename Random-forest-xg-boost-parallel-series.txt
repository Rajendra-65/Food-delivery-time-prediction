Random Forest (Bunch of Tree)

	Wisdom of Croud (collective decision of many people)

	e.g Supreme court Bench Case

	All the tree from Random Forest are Decision Tree.
	
	We must tell that number of estimator needed n.estimator

	we get same or different value in Random Forest.
	
	All the individual model are decision Tree.
	
Ensemble Model
	
	90% of model are Ensemble Model.	

	useful when we are deal with overfitting.

	Not 1 model we use Multi Model.
	
	Suppose we are predicting the price. 
	
	m1 = 20  , m2 = 22

	price could be = ( 20 + 22 ) / 2 => 21


parallel Model (RANDOM FOREST)
		
			data


	m1	m2 	m3	m4 	m5

	22	22 	20 	25	30

	
	avg of m = price


Series Model (XG BOOST , GBM)


			data

			 m1
			 m2
			 m3

Building on each other. It can be same or Different.


same = > Bagging (parallel combination of model)

Different => Boosting  (Series combination of model)

/ Stacking / Bleding => models in parallel (model are different)


sampling with Replacement => Bootstrap Sampling

Bios and Variance (Trade Off)

M1			D ->	Training
			  ->  Testing  (unseen Data)

Testing Accuracy -> 60% (model not learned Enough Highly biased)

increase the complience  decrease the bias and increase the bias. 


Training ] -> 95 %
					=> Good Model
Test ]->  91 %   


if Training = 100 % then it is overfitted 

also testing result would be very unsatishfied.  


Boosting (Sequential Learning) (GBM)


	Models in Sequence

	Learn from each other

  
Gradient = Different

Boosting = Improvement

Model = trained MOdel


m1          =>  		m2		=> 		m3


		r1		r1y1		r2		r2y2


xgboost 

	extreme gradient bossting mechanism
	Faster
	boost ++
 

Cross  Validation

Train , Test , Validation


100 data divided into 80 - 20


1 part = 1 fold

5 part = 5 fold then combined the accuracy

Taking average of training and testing Accuracy.

5 fold cross validation = k cross validation.
