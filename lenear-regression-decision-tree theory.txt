Machine Learning is Learning From Inshight Through Algorithm.

Machine Takes Time and Experience to learn from Inshight.

Machine can learn in two ways

A. Rule System

B. Huership

Goal Of machine Learning is to find the Logic what is the function beheind th e output.


[x,y f(x)]  -> Supervised
		-> unsupervised
		-> Reinforcement

function = coefficient + variable.

we differentiate the function to get the limits.

error function = 1/2n summation i = 0 to n pow((y - (Q1x1 +b)),2)

-----   Example Algo -----


y = mx+c


f(3) = m3 + c

####

y = Q1X1 + b					Y' -> real
							Y  -> Predicted
							x1' -> feature (we dont know)

error = Y' - y					Q1  -> coefficient (we know)



error = y1' -(Q1X1'+b)

error-total = 1 / pow(n,2) Sum i=0 to n pow((yi'-(Q1x1powi+b)),2) ## cost func



### Error Reduction


d f(x) / dx = f'x

f(x) = max
	 min

f'(x) = 0 
  x = 1, 2 (For maxima and Minima)
